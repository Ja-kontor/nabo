The resources on the map can be sorted in various ways, so that you see just a list of venues, galleries, event makers, etc. Most of the information is in Danish. Below you can find translations of each category. If you have a hard time reading the ressource descriptions, we recommend using a tool like google translate, or browsing with a Danish-reading friend.",
